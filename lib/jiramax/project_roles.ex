  Get all project roles

  ### About project roles ###

  [Project roles](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).

  Project roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.

  #### Members and actors ####

  In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.

  Actors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:

   *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
   *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.
