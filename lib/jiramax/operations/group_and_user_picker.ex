  Find users and groups

  Returns a list of users and groups matching a string. The string is used:

   *  for users, to find a case-insensitive match with display name and e-mail address. Note that if a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required.
   *  for groups, to find a case-sensitive match with group name.

  For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the display name *Tina*, email address *sarah@tinplatetraining.com*, and the group *accounting* would be returned.

  Optionally, the search can be refined to:

   *  the projects and issue types associated with a custom field, such as a user picker. The search can then be further refined to return only users and groups that have permission to view specific:
      
       *  projects.
       *  issue types.
      
      If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.
   *  not return Connect app users and groups.
   *  return groups that have a case-insensitive match with the query.

  The primary use case for this resource is to populate a picker field suggestion list with users or groups. To this end, the returned object includes an `html` field for each list. This field highlights the matched query term in the item name with the HTML strong tag. Also, each list is wrapped in a response object that contains a header for use in a picker, specifically *Showing X of Y matching groups*.

  This operation can be accessed anonymously.

  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg).

  ## Options

    * `query`: The search string.
    * `maxResults`: The maximum number of items to return in each list.
    * `showAvatar`: Whether the user avatar should be returned. If an invalid value is provided, the default value is used.
    * `fieldId`: The custom field ID of the field this request is for.
    * `projectId`: The ID of a project that returned users and groups must have permission to view. To include multiple projects, provide an ampersand-separated list. For example, `projectId=10000&projectId=10001`. This parameter is only used when `fieldId` is present.
    * `issueTypeId`: The ID of an issue type that returned users and groups must have permission to view. To include multiple issue types, provide an ampersand-separated list. For example, `issueTypeId=10000&issueTypeId=10001`. Special values, such as `-1` (all standard issue types) and `-2` (all subtask issue types), are supported. This parameter is only used when `fieldId` is present.
    * `avatarSize`: The size of the avatar to return. If an invalid value is provided, the default value is used.
    * `caseInsensitive`: Whether the search for groups should be case insensitive.
    * `excludeConnectAddons`: Whether Connect app users and groups should be excluded from the search results. If an invalid value is provided, the default value is used.
