  Create issue link

  Creates a link between two issues. Use this operation to indicate a relationship between two issues and optionally add a comment to the from (outward) issue. To use this resource the site must have [Issue Linking](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yoXKM) enabled.

  This resource returns nothing on the creation of an issue link. To obtain the ID of the issue link, use `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/[linked issue key]?fields=issuelinks`.

  If the link request duplicates a link, the response indicates that the issue link was created. If the request included a comment, the comment is added.
