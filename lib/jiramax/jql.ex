  This operation can filter the custom fields returned by project. Invalid project IDs in `projectIds` are ignored. System fields are always returned.

  It can also return the collapsed field for custom fields. Collapsed fields enable searches to be performed across all fields with the same name and of the same field type. For example, the collapsed field `Component - Component[Dropdown]` enables dropdown fields `Component - cf[10061]` and `Component - cf[10062]` to be searched simultaneously.

  Get field auto complete suggestions

  Returns the JQL search auto complete suggestions for a field.

  Suggestions can be obtained by providing:

   *  `fieldName` to get a list of all values for the field.
   *  `fieldName` and `fieldValue` to get a list of values containing the text in `fieldValue`.
   *  `fieldName` and `predicateName` to get a list of all predicate values for the field.

  ## Options

    * `fieldName`: The name of the field.
    * `fieldValue`: The partial field item name entered by the user.
    * `predicateName`: The name of the [ CHANGED operator predicate](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/hQORLQ#Advancedsearching-operatorsreference-CHANGEDCHANGED) for which the suggestions are generated. The valid predicate operators are *by*, *from*, and *to*.

  Sanitize JQL queries

  Sanitizes one or more JQL queries by converting readable details into IDs where a user doesn't have permission to view the entity.

  For example, if the query contains the clause *project = 'Secret project'*, and a user does not have browse permission for the project "Secret project", the sanitized query replaces the clause with *project = 12345"* (where 12345 is the ID of the project). If a user has the required permission, the clause is not sanitized. If the account ID is null, sanitizing is performed for an anonymous user.

  Note that sanitization doesn't make the queries GDPR-compliant, because it doesn't remove user identifiers (username or user key). If you need to make queries GDPR-compliant, use [Convert user identifiers to account IDs in JQL queries](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-jql/#api-rest-api-3-jql-sanitize-post).

  Before sanitization each JQL query is parsed. The queries are returned in the same order that they were passed.
