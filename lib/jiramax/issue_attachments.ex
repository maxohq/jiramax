  Add attachment

  Adds one or more attachments to an issue. Attachments are posted as multipart/form-data ([RFC 1867](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt)).

  Note that:

   *  The request must have a `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` header, if not it is blocked. See [Special headers](#special-request-headers) for more information.
   *  The name of the multipart/form-data parameter that contains the attachments must be `file`.

  The following examples upload a file called *myfile.txt* to the issue *TEST-123*:

  #### curl ####

      curl --location --request POST 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/TEST-123/attachments'
       -u 'email@example.com:<api_token>'
       -H 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check'
       --form 'file=@"myfile.txt"'

  Tip: Use a client library. Many client libraries have classes for handling multipart POST operations. For example, in Java, the Apache HTTP Components library provides a [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html) class for multipart POST operations.

  This operation can be accessed anonymously.
