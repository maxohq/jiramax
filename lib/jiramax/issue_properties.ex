  Bulk delete issue property

  Deletes a property value from multiple issues. The issues to be updated can be specified by filter criteria.

  The criteria the filter used to identify eligible issues are:

   *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
   *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.

  If both criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy both criteria are considered eligible.

  If no filter criteria are specified, all the issues visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES permission for the issue are considered eligible.

  This operation is:

   *  transactional, either the property is deleted from all eligible issues or, when errors occur, no properties are deleted.
   *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.

  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

   *  *Browse projects* [ project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for each project containing issues.
   *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
   *  *Edit issues* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for each issue.

  Bulk set issue property

  Sets a property value on multiple issues.

  The value set can be a constant or determined by a [Jira expression](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/). Expressions must be computable with constant complexity when applied to a set of issues. Expressions must also comply with the [restrictions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions) that apply to all Jira expressions.

  The issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.

  The filter identifies issues eligible for update using these criteria:

   *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
   *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.
   *  `hasProperty`:
      
       *  If *true*, only issues with the property are eligible.
       *  If *false*, only issues without the property are eligible.

  If more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are eligible.

  If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is returned. For example, specifying a `currentValue` and `hasProperty` as *false* would not match any issues (because without the property the property cannot have a value).

  The filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES permission for the issue are considered eligible.

   *  transactional, either all eligible issues are updated or, when errors occur, none are updated.
